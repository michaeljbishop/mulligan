<p>"In golf, a mulligan is a stroke that is replayed from the spot of the previous stroke without penalty, due to an errant shot made on the previous stroke. The result is, as the hole is played and scored, as if the first errant shot had never been made." -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulligan_(games)#Mulligan_in_golf">Wikipedia</a></p>

<a name="the-spy-before-radios-were-invented" class="anchor" href="#the-spy-before-radios-were-invented"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Spy Before Radios Were Invented</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a spy who had to infiltrate a 17 floor building, each new floor thick with guards. On the top floor was a safe to which he was given a combination. The safe would blow up if the wrong combination was used so he had to be careful. He successfully arrived at the safe after sneaking through all the floors and then he realized on his notes, the combination he was given was "66-99-66".</p>

<p>To his dismay, he couldn't tell if he was reading it upside-down, and because radios hadn't yet been invented, Intelligence couldn't be contacted and not knowing what to do, he bailed on the mission by jumping out the window and was rescued on the ground by the allies. They told him he was holding the combination upside-down but now he'd have to again go through all 17 floors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This the current state of Ruby exception handling. Once an exception is raised, you "abort the mission" and jump out the window where you are rescued. But then you have to start the mission again.</p>

<h4>
<a name="the-spy-after-radios-were-invented" class="anchor" href="#the-spy-after-radios-were-invented"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Spy After Radios Were Invented</h4>

<p>Here's the story again, but let's pretend radios now exist:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a spy ... yada yada yada... It was then that he realized the combination he was given was 66-99-66.</p>

<p><strong><em>Because this mission now includes radios</em></strong>, he was able to call intelligence, tell them what was happening and they told him he was holding the note upside-down. He then continued the mission by turning the note right-side-up and opening the safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Mulligan gem adds to your exception handling, the radio from the second story. The Ruby <code>rescue</code> clause is like 'Intelligence' who receives the call (as an Exception instance). But attached to that Exception instance are 'recovery objects' which contain data about how to solve the problem. By invoking a recovery object, the code continues to exit without the mission aborting.</p>

<a name="how-come-we-didnt-see-handled-in-that-output" class="anchor" href="#how-come-we-didnt-see-handled-in-that-output"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How come we didn't see "HANDLED" in that output?</h3>

<p>Here's what happened in detail:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<code>#method_that_raises</code> is called from <code>#calling_method</code> (line 15)</li>
<li>
<code>#method_that_raises</code> raises an exception <em>but</em> before it is raised, a "recovery" can be added to the exception (line 6). That 'when' statement actually creates a an instance of <code>IgnoringRecovery</code>.</li>
<li>The exception is then raised (line 9) and rescued (line 17)</li>
<li>The "recovery" on the exception is called (line 19) which takes program execution back to line 7.</li>
<li>Now, we are inside code that has succeeded the test in then <code>when</code> of line 6. Now it hits the <code>else</code> clause and skips the <code>#raise</code>
</li>
<li>The method exits (line 12) and we return to line 16 as if we never saw the exception.</li>
<li>We exit the method because there's no exception to rescue (line 21). The last value in the function was "SUCCESS" so that is returned.</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="use-cases" class="anchor" href="#use-cases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use Cases</h3>

<p>The truth is, often when we throw an exception in code, we probably could actually continue if we just knew what to do. Specifying recoveries allows you to suggest some options to the rescuing code.</p>

<p>Not only that, you can apply a recovery strategy to large parts of code by handling exceptions at a high level and recovering from them.</p>

<p>From the Dylan Language Manual:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A condition is an object used to locate and provide information to a handler. A condition represents a situation that needs to be handled. Examples are errors, warnings, and attempts to recover from errors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>("condition" is what we are calling "exception" in Ruby)</p>

<p>This is going to be inherently messy and for a long-running program like this, potentially painful to restart if the data is found to be incorrect. Much better to just put in some recoveries and choose from them if errors are found.</p>

<p>You might write a parser to read XML or a log file format and it might encounter malformed entries. You can make that low-level parser code much more reusable if you specify a few recoveries in the raised exceptions. Higher level code will have many more choices to handle errors.</p>

<h4>
<a name="to-start-a-case-statement" class="anchor" href="#to-start-a-case-statement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To Start A Case Statement</h4>

<p><code>recovery</code> is used at the beginning of a <code>case</code> structure to indicate that each <code>when</code> clause is defining a <code>Recovery</code> instance to be attached to the next raised <code>Exception</code> instance.</p>

<p>Here is the structure for using it:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">recovery</span>
<span class="k">when</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">recovery_class</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>           <span class="c1"># or</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">code</span>
<span class="k">when</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">recovery_class</span><span class="o">&gt;.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># or</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">code</span>
<span class="k">when</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">method_or_statement_that_returns_recovery_instance_or_class</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">code</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">exception</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The structure for this has to be quite strict. You <em>have</em> to put the raise inside the <code>else</code> and not before. (For more explanation, see the Appendix)</p>

<h4>
<a name="to-retrieve-a-recovery" class="anchor" href="#to-retrieve-a-recovery"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To Retrieve a Recovery</h4>

<p>You can also call <code>recovery(&lt;recovery_class&gt;)</code> when inside a rescue statement to see if there is a recovery attached to the exception that fits that class.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="no">Exception</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span>
  <span class="n">recover</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">IgnoringRecovery</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="n">recovery</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">IgnoringRecovery</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">nil?</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>
<a name="kernelrecover" class="anchor" href="#kernelrecover"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kernel#recover</h3>

<p>Inside a <code>rescue</code> clause, this invokes the recovery object. There is no return value from this. Code execution now proceeds back down into the stack to to the location in the case statement that matches the recovery class.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="no">Exception</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span>
  <span class="n">recover</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">IgnoringRecovery</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="n">recovery</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">IgnoringRecovery</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">nil?</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Also note that you can pass arguments which can be retrieved by the code implementing the <code>Recovery</code>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="mulliganrecovery" class="anchor" href="#mulliganrecovery"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mulligan::Recovery</h3>

<p><code>Mulligan::Recovery</code> is the base class of all recoveries. Use this in the same way you use the <code>Exception</code> hierarchy, but for recoveries. You can define your own subclasses with different properties that can be read by the <code>rescue</code> clauses.</p>

<h4>
<a name="message-attribute" class="anchor" href="#message-attribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>'message' attribute</h4>

<p>This is a human-readable description of what the <code>Recovery</code> does. It can be set at the time of raising, or if it's not set, will return <code>#default_message</code></p>

<h4>
<a name="default_message" class="anchor" href="#default_message"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>#default_message</h4>

<p>It's very important that you specify the <code>#default_message</code> method in your subclass. If your exception bubbles to the top-level within Pry, you can inspect the attached <code>Recovery</code> instances and execute them yourself. Without that <code>#default_message</code> method, you'll have no idea what a given Recovery will do.</p>

Mulligan fully supports MRI versions 1.9.3 -&gt; 2.1.1</p>

<p>Mulligan will gracefully degrade to standard exception handling on other platforms. Though the API will be there, no recoveries will be attached to Exceptions.</p>

<ul>
<li>If <code>Kernel#recover</code> is called in a Ruby that doesn't fully support Mulligan, it will be ignored and code execution will continue. This allows you to first try a recovery and after that, write the code that you would do before you had Mulligan.</li>

<a name="faq" class="anchor" href="#faq"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ</h2>

<h3>
<a name="recovery-whats-wrong-with-restart" class="anchor" href="#recovery-whats-wrong-with-restart"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>"Recovery"? What's wrong with "Restart"?</h3>

<p>I had to make a hard choice about naming the thing that allows an exception to be recovered from. "Restart" is the word used in Lisp, but because it is used as a verb and as a noun, it makes it hard to know what a Ruby method named <code>#restart</code> would do. Does it return a "restart" or does it execute a restart?</p>

<p>Changing the name to a noun subtracts that confusion (though arguably adds some back for those coming from languages where the "restart" name is entrenched).</p>

<a name="will-mulligan-let-me-resume-from-all-exceptions" class="anchor" href="#will-mulligan-let-me-resume-from-all-exceptions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Will Mulligan let me resume from all exceptions?</h3>

<p>No. If an exception didn't have recoveries attached when it was raised, you will not be able to call them. It is incumbent on the code that raises the exception to add the recoveries so they can control the error-handling flow.</p>
