<p>"In golf, a mulligan is a stroke that is replayed from the spot of the previous stroke without penalty, due to an errant shot made on the previous stroke. The result is, as the hole is played and scored, as if the first errant shot had never been made." -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulligan_(games)#Mulligan_in_golf">Wikipedia</a></p>

<a name="the-spy-before-radios-were-invented" class="anchor" href="#the-spy-before-radios-were-invented"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Spy Before Radios Were Invented</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a spy who had to infiltrate a 17 floor building, each new floor thick with guards. On the top floor was a safe to which he was given a combination. The safe would blow up if the wrong combination was used so he had to be careful. After sneaking through all the floors, he successfully arrived at the safe and then he realized on his notes the combination read "66-99-66".</p>

<p>He couldn't tell if he was reading it upside-down, and because radios hadn't yet been invented, Intelligence couldn't be contacted. Not knowing what to do he bailed on the mission by jumping out the window and was rescued on the ground by the allies. They told him he was indeed holding the combination upside-down but now he'd have to again go through all 17 floors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This the current state of Ruby exception handling. Once an exception is raised, you "abort the mission" and jump out the window where you are rescued.</p>

<p>... but then you have to start the mission again.</p>

<h4>
<a name="the-spy-after-radios-were-invented" class="anchor" href="#the-spy-after-radios-were-invented"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Spy After Radios Were Invented</h4>

<p>Here's the story again, but let's pretend radios now exist:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a spy ... It was then that he realized the combination he was given was 66-99-66.</p>

<p><strong><em>Because this mission now includes radios</em></strong>, he was able to call intelligence, tell them what was happening and they told him he was holding the note upside-down. He then continued the mission by turning the note right-side-up and opening the safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Mulligan gem adds <em>the radio</em> to your exception handling. The Ruby <code>rescue</code> clause is like 'Intelligence' who receives the call (as an Exception instance), but now attached to that Exception instance are 'recovery objects' which contain data about how to solve the problem. By invoking a recovery object, the code continues to exit without the mission aborting.</p>

<h3>
<a name="code-example" class="anchor" href="#code-example"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code Example</h3>

<p>Here's a very simple contrived example, simply to show flow control:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'mulligan'</span>

  <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"AFTER RAISE"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Running this at the REPL shows:</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p353 :009 &gt; calling_method
RAISING
RESCUED
IGNORING

 =&gt; "SUCCESS"

<p>Notice that we did't see "HANDLED" in the output</p>

<h3>
<a name="use-cases" class="anchor" href="#use-cases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use Cases</h3>

<p>The truth is, often when we throw an exception in code, we probably could actually continue if we just knew what to do. Specifying recoveries allows you to suggest some options to the rescuing code.</p>

<p>Not only that, you can apply a recovery strategy to large parts of code by handling exceptions at a high level and recovering from them.</p>

<p>From the Dylan Language Manual:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A condition is an object used to locate and provide information to a handler. A condition represents a situation that needs to be handled. Examples are errors, warnings, and attempts to recover from errors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>("condition" is what we are calling "exception" in Ruby)</p>

<p>This is going to be inherently messy and for a long-running program like this, potentially painful to restart if the data is found to be incorrect. Much better to just put in some recoveries and choose from them if errors are found.</p>

<p>You might write a parser to read XML or a log file format and it might encounter malformed entries. You can make that low-level parser code much more reusable if you specify a few recoveries in the raised exceptions. Higher level code will have many more choices to handle errors.</p>

<a name="to-start-a-case-statement" class="anchor" href="#to-start-a-case-statement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To Start A 'case' Statement</h4>

<p><code>recovery</code> is used at the beginning of a <code>case</code> structure to indicate that each <code>when</code> clause is defining a <code>Recovery</code> instance to be attached to the next raised <code>Exception</code> instance.</p>

<p>Here is the structure for using it:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">recovery</span>
<span class="k">when</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">recovery_class</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>           <span class="c1"># or</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The structure for this has to be quite strict. You <em>have</em> to put the <code>raise</code> inside the <code>else</code>. (For more explanation, see the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>)</p>

<h4>
<a name="to-retrieve-a-recovery" class="anchor" href="#to-retrieve-a-recovery"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To Retrieve a Recovery</h4>

<p>You can also call <code>recovery(&lt;recovery_class&gt;)</code> when inside a rescue statement to see if there is a recovery attached to the exception that fits that class.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="no">Exception</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">recovery</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">IgnoringRecovery</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">nil?</span>

</pre></div>

<h3>
<a name="kernelrecover" class="anchor" href="#kernelrecover"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kernel#recover</h3>

<p>Inside a <code>rescue</code> clause, this invokes the recovery object. There is no return value from this. Code execution now proceeds back down into the stack to to the location in the case statement that matches the recovery class.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="no">Exception</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span>

<h3>
<a name="mulliganrecovery" class="anchor" href="#mulliganrecovery"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mulligan::Recovery</h3>

<p><code>Mulligan::Recovery</code> is the base class of all recoveries. Use this in the same way you use the <code>Exception</code> hierarchy, but for recoveries. You can define your own subclasses with different properties that can be read by the <code>rescue</code> clauses.</p>

<h4>
<a name="metadata" class="anchor" href="#metadata"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Metadata</h4>

<p>One thing to note. There is useful metadata associated with a recovery. This is because if you are running your code inside Pry using pry-rescue and an exception is raised uncaught, Pry will open and you can choose a recovery from the list attached to the exception. Your program will then continue as if the exception were never thrown.</p>

<p>Here is the metadata:</p>

<h4>
<a name="summary-attribute" class="anchor" href="#summary-attribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>'summary' attribute</h4>

<p>This is a human-readable description one-line descriptions of what the <code>Recovery</code> does. By default it returns the class attribute, but you can override it in the instance.</p>

<h4>
<a name="discussion-attribute" class="anchor" href="#discussion-attribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>'discussion' attribute</h4>

<p>This is a detailed discussion of how to use the recovery. Think of it as if you were writing help for a command-line tool and wanted to describe the options and arguments. By default it returns the class attribute, but you can override it in the instance.</p>

<p>If you call <code>Exception#recoveries.inspect</code> inside Pry, you will get a string that looks more or less like this:</p>

<pre><code>Mulligan::RetryingRecovery
--------------------------
Performs again the last task which caused the failure.
Attributes:
  'count' - The number of times this recovery has been
            invoked. In this way, you can keep track of
            how many times the code has been retried and
            perhaps limit the total number of retries.

Mulligan::IgnoringRecovery
--------------------------
Ignores the exception and continues execution.
If this recovery is attached to an Exception, you may
safely continue.
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="ruby-compatibility" class="anchor" href="#ruby-compatibility"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ruby Compatibility</h2>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/michaeljbishop/mulligan"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/michaeljbishop/mulligan.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status"></a>
Mulligan fully supports MRI versions 1.9.3 -&gt; 2.1.1</p>

<p>On all other rubies, Mulligan will gracefully degrade to standard exception handling. Though the API will be there, no recoveries will be attached to Exceptions.</p>

<p>If  you call <code>Kernel#recover</code> in a Ruby that doesn't fully support Mulligan, it will be ignored and code execution will continue. This allows you to first try a recovery before writing the code that you would do before you had Mulligan.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="no">TimeoutException</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span>

  <span class="c1"># We don't have Mulligan. re-raise the exception</span>
  <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="n">e</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Because of this, there is <strong><em>no downside</em></strong> to adding recoveries to your library. By doing so, you are simply making your library more useful to those who use it.</p>

<a name="faq" class="anchor" href="#faq"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ</h2>

<h3>
<a name="recovery-whats-wrong-with-restart" class="anchor" href="#recovery-whats-wrong-with-restart"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>"Recovery"? What's wrong with "Restart"?</h3>

<p>I had to make a hard choice about naming the thing that allows an exception to be recovered from. "Restart" is the word used in Lisp, but because it is used as a verb and as a noun, it makes it hard to know what a Ruby method named <code>#restart</code> would do. Does it return a "restart" or does it execute a restart?</p>

<p>Changing the name to a noun subtracts that confusion (though arguably adds some back for those coming from languages where the "restart" name is entrenched).</p>

<p>No. If an exception didn't have recoveries attached when it was raised, you will not be able to call them. It is incumbent on the code that raises the exception to add the recoveries so they can control the error-handling flow.</p>
